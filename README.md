## What is datashare?
Datashare is a program that runs in the background sending files and data to a host server that will temporarily log this data. This data can be accessed by anyone with the link to the host server. This program is intended to be used for sharing files and data with other people. This program is not intended to be used for malicious purposes. I am not responsible for any misuse of this program.


## Why did I make this?
I have multiple developer environments, such as my laptop, my desktop at home, my desktop at the office, and other virtual machines. I wanted a way to easily share files between these environments. For example, if I code 70% of an algorithm on my home desktop instead of having to push unfinished code, I can just walk away, even shut off my computer and when I go to a different environment I can just pick up straight where I left off by getting the files off of the website that the host server will host.
